# BootStrapPortfolio
::INTRO::

As the second deliverable in this course, I found it to be slightly less challenging than the first assignment. The reason being that when tasked with something I dont fuly comprehend, my natural incliniation is to assume that it is difficult. This assignment was simple in its requirement but still there were portions that I struggled with during the execution. Mainly, responsiveness of the page when collapsed. My photo did not reposition itself like the text and footer. This is a problem I will have to put more focus on going forward. Other than that, i found it to be straightforward.

::ABOUT::

This assignment was a exercise in taking the skillset we are building and adding responsiveness through bootstrap cdn and javascript. Ultimately, creating a similar site to our portfolios in the first project, while adding tools gained since it completion.

::THE CODE::

Utilizing bootstrap was an exercise in simplicity. unfortunately, I was not as versed in the concept as I would have like to be. I feel I overcomplicated this task. This in turn, led me to try to utilize css in junction with botstrap. The combination of the two was not the outcome I had hoped for. Going forward, I can see how it is best practice to focus on one or the other. Preferably, using bootstrap as the deferred option.

::COLLABORATORS::

My Tutor Sangeetha K was instrumental in acomplishing the task set before me
